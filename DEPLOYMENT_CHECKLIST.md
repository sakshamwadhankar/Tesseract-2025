## Deployment Steps

### For Vercel

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Tesseract 2025 deployment"
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Import your repository
   - Select "Next.js" as framework

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from `.env.example`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete

### For Netlify

1. **Build Command**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Publish Directory**
   ```
   .next
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Add in Netlify dashboard under Site Settings

### For Self-Hosting

1. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start Production Server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. **Use PM2 for Process Management**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start npm --name "tesseract" -- start
   pm2 save
   pm2 startup
   ```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### âœ… Production Tests
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Console has no critical errors
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] All pages accessible

### âœ… Security Checks
- [ ] Service role key not exposed in client
- [ ] RLS policies preventing unauthorized access
- [ ] Admin routes protected
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] CORS configured properly

### âœ… Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Code splitting working
- [ ] Caching enabled

## Monitoring Setup

### Supabase Dashboard
- Monitor API usage: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lwyxcndmbpotaegbzswh/reports/api-overview
- Check database performance
- Monitor authentication logs
- Review RLS policy violations

### Error Tracking (Optional)
```javascript
// Add to your app
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Add Sentry or similar error tracking
}
```

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
- Supabase automatically backs up daily
- Download manual backup before major changes:
  ```sql
  -- In SQL Editor
  SELECT * FROM projects;
  SELECT * FROM votes;
  SELECT * FROM admins;
  ```

### Code Backups
- Use Git for version control
- Tag releases: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"`
- Keep staging branch for testing

## Scaling Considerations

### When You Hit Limits
1. **Database**: Upgrade Supabase plan
2. **Hosting**: Scale Vercel/Netlify plan
3. **Performance**: Implement caching layer
4. **Security**: Add rate limiting

### Rate Limiting (Add if needed)
```javascript
// In your API routes
const rateLimit = {
  votes: 10, // Max votes per minute
  auth: 5,   // Max login attempts per minute
}
```

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Weekly: Check error logs
- [ ] Monthly: Review analytics
- [ ] Quarterly: Security audit
- [ ] Yearly: Dependency updates

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Too many requests"
- Solution: Implement rate limiting

**Issue**: "Database connection lost"
- Solution: Check Supabase status, implement retry logic

**Issue**: "Votes not recording"
- Solution: Check RLS policies, verify user authentication
